The above table shows the ethical quandaries that arose from Edward Snowden's release of classified documents about the NSA and which technical/socio-technical systems they affected. I addressed mainly the ethical quandaries that came from the actions of Snowden himself, but I also addressed the quandary of the government surveillance programs as well as the media companies that published classified info.

The US government was affected by all of the ethical quandaries, and so was the NSA except for they were not directly affected by Snowden taking asylum in Russia after the events of the leak. The journalism industry was affected by the classified documents, their publication, and Snowden's asylum in Russia, because they had to decide how to ethically cover all of these events. International relations with Russia were mostly impacted by Snowden fleeing there. The cybersecurity industry was affected by each quandary having to do with the security of information -- cybersecurity continues to become more important as more security breaches happen. Finally, the American people were most significantly impacted by the surveillance itself, but also by the release of the documents as it forced the government to expose those programs.
